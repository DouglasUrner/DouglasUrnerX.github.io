# HTML & CSS-Puzzles
Examples of problems that you encountered and solved.

Fork this repository and then add a file with your example problem / puzzle in it. Give the file a unique name, say: *my-problem.html*

Add a link in the index.html to your file and then make a pull request. Right after you make the pull request, make a second pull request with the fix in a new file with the same name as your problem file plus *-fixed*, so if you used *my-problem.html* for the first one, the the fix would be *my-problem-fixed.html*.
